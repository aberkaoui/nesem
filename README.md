# nesem - Yet Another NES Emulator

nesem is a simple NES emulator built as a learning project.
Most of the credit should go to to [OneLoneCoder](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder) and his [original project](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES).

The goal of my repository is to reproduce from scratch the original code but with my own design philosophy and as such not really copying.
In any case, if you're interested in this project, I myself recommend that you check out the [original repository](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES) since it includes more detailed, beginner-friendly documentation.

Overall, it helps understand the NES internals, including its infamous 6502 CPU, PPU, APU, memory, etc., and to a certain extent how von Neumann architecture-based computer systems operate.
