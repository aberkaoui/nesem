To David Barr, aka javidx9, aka OneLoneCoder, for his exceptional NES emulator from scratch, giving me a great way to improve my primitive C++ knowledge on such a large project.

"So far the OneLoneCoder initiative has inspired and helped hundreds of programmers. It's important that derivative works reflect, and frankly advertise that this initiative exists."
